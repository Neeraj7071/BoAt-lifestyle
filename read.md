We gathered around by creating a group. Then we communicated by using Zoom and Slack as a team to discuss cloning the website. First of all, we introduced ourselves to each other and Then we divided our work accordingly.
We created a Repository on Github.com named Boat-Lifestyle. after that everyone joined that Repository by using an invitation link generated by Neeraj Khajuriya.
We explored all the important things on Github and Github Desktop including push, pull, creation of branches, commit, etc.
We started by going through the website, studying its design, layouts, content, etc…..
